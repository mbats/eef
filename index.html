        <h4>Take care of your users</h4>
        <p>
          Editing models is an important task for the tools developed with EMF. EEF enables you to produce more usable user interface to edit EMF models via a generative process. EEF generates by default JFace wizards and properties views to edit your models but you can use the generated interfaces in any kind of your UI parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          EEF is a good EMF world citizen, all customizations done on the EMF layer are integrated in the EEF interfaces. Frameworks like EMF Validation, EMF Transaction, etc natively work with EEF.
