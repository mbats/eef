description: As Claire, I need to have continuous integration
---
In order to have continuous integration of my project we need:

* Maven and Tycho-based build
* Junit-based unit tests running in the build
* Checkstyle-based static analysis
* Hudson-based build for the branch
* Hudson-based build for Gerrit
* Promotion on a nightly update site
* Aggregation in the Simultaneous Release
