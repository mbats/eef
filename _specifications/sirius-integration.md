The following user stories will help us define how we want to integrate Eclipse EEF 2.0 with Eclipse Sirius 4.0

##### User stories

###### US-1 As an end user, Lucas wants to see a Properties view when he clicks on a mapping

If he clicks on a mapping, the Properties view should be update to display the properties of the element selected

###### US-2 As an end user, Lucas wants to see changes from Sirius appear in the Properties view

If he edits the name of an EObject using a Sirius direct edit tool, the Properties view should be updated

###### US-3 As an end user, Lucas wants to see changes from the Properties view appear in Sirius

If he edits the name of an EObject using the Properties view, the change should appear in Sirius

###### US-4 As an end user, Lucas wants to see the EEF Properties View when using the Model Explorer view


###### US-5 As an end user, Lucas wants to edit a property of multiple elements at once

-> select five EClass and mark them all abstract at once

###### US-6 nothing to specify to have a default user interface

-> default widgets (string -> EEFTextDescription) etc

###### US-7 how to customize it

generate it once, generate it at runtime ? extension point ?
