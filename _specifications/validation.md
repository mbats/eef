We need to be able to validate the data entered by the end users.

##### User stories

###### Lucas - End User

As Lucas, I should have validation information for every kind of fields that I can edit. This validation should be available with at least a message using a color specific to the kind of message received. It should be possible to receive multiple kinds of validation notifications.

###### Claire - EEF Developer

As Claire, I should be able to provide validation information by reusing EMF Edit.

###### Zoe - Sirius Specifier

As Zoe, I should be able to provide additional validation notifications.
