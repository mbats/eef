##### M4 11/12/15 availability 4 weeks or 30 days (planning 30 days)

The goal of this milestone is to build an industrialized prototype.
At the end of this milestone, we provide an update site for EEF and an update site for a specific Sirius version. 
With this milestone a Sirius specifier is able to specify in a odesign file a new properties view description. He is able to create in the VSM properties views, tabs, sections and Text widgets. Following the Sirius philosophy, the properties view description is interpreted at runtime by Sirius and is based on binding description. Same as in classical Sirius representation, the mapping are based on semantic candidates defined with domain class and interpreted expressions.
When the end user selects a diagram element in a Sirius based modeler, the properties view shows the selected element properties. Only text widget elements are available.

###### DSLs

- Remove unnecessary concepts from `eef.ecore` (domain class?) **2d**
  - fresh start with a new `eef.ecore` and rename the old one (we won't have the generated code of the "old" one)
  - only keep the concepts that can be used from `properties.ecore`, and only the ones needed for the current milestone.
- _Sirius_: add support for unknown/optional extensions in the VSM (in particular, under _Group_) [*done*](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/61001/)
  - use EMF's native mechanism (see http://ed-merks.blogspot.fr/2008/01/creating-children-you-didnt-know.html)
  - take this opportunity to remove Sirius's legacy way of doing this and replace it with EMF's mechanism

###### Widgets

- Add support for different semantic candidates (pages / groups) **7d** => PCD
  - change the "self" used for a Page, a Group, etc...
    - see org.eclipse.eef.core.internal.EEFPageImpl.createControl()
  - accessible variables for each expression? how to manage them?
     - "IVariableManager" in a Sirius bundle named `org.eclipse.sirius.common.query`
  - **depends on work on the Sirius side** (see below)
   
- Fully implement a simple _Text Field_ widget
  - lifecycle (edit initial operation / valueExpression) **1d**
    - see org.eclipse.eef.ide.ui.internal.data.EEFSection.aboutToBeShown().new IConsumer() {...}.apply(String)
  - refactor the controller and instantiation of the widgets **2d**
    - org.eclipse.eef.ide.ui.internal.data.EEFSection.createControls(Composite, TabbedPropertySheetPage)

###### Interpreters

This work will be **realized by the Sirius team** in `oes.common.query.*`: **2d** => PCD
- extract next-gen query API in new `org.eclipse.sirius.common.query` that do not depend on the rest of Sirius and can be used by EEF.
- beside improvements made possible by a fresh start, the new version show take care to provide a good solution for variable scope management, and variables in general (to prepare for more complex features planned for later with expressions.ecore).
- new interpreter API in sirius (specification and integration)
  - variables lifecycle (remove setVariables / unsetVariables)
  - completion proposals (EMF 2.8's styled strings for the display and information)
  - camel case support and filters for the interpreters and proposals

###### Default behavior and customization

- default behavior of properties.ecore
  - definition of the default behavior expected (each structural should have a default widget in the order of the structural features)
  - definition of the default rules in a default.properties **1d**
- how can we keep / remove other tabs provided by other tools (GMF, Advanced, Semantic) **2d**
  - may **depend on work on the Sirius side**

###### Lifecycle

We need to have a clear vision of the way the lifecycle of our application works. At the very least we should document the rules and constraints imposed by the Eclipse properties view framework. If possible we should hide some/most of the complexity under a simpler faÃ§ade which isolates the rest of our work from the complexities and/or enforce the constraints.

- lifecycle to create the Properties view **1d**
- lifecycle of the interaction with Eclipse Sirius **2d**
- take into account the validation **1d**
- read only **1d**
- evaluate the performances and capabilities of SWT **2d**
  - ability to create and destroy widgets (hide them?)
  - scaling (how many widgets? are pages not displayed refreshed?)
  - this may 

###### EMF Edit

Specification with the Sirius team **2d**

- identify the parts of EMF.Edit that make sense to expose more directly from the VSM (e.g. when configuring a _labelExpression_, it should be easy to say "use the label provider I've already customized for my metamodel")
- prioritize which of these mechanisms will be needed earlier than others to be exploited by EEF
- launch the corresponding work on the Sirius team

###### Release engineering and project management

- technical documentation **2d**
- unit tests, continuous integration and integration with Gerrit **2d**
- contribute to the EEF update site for Eclipse Sirius

##### M5 29/01/16 availability 7 weeks or 50 days (planning 46 days)

The goal of this milestone is to support basic widgets and dynamic mappings.
At the end of this milestone, we provide some more basic widgets : Checkbox, Combo, Label, Radio, TextArea, Button.
It is also possible for the specifier to define dynamic mappings to specify with one mapping description many widgets. For example, it will be possible to define that 'EString' attributes defined in the meta-model will be represented with a Text widget.
At the end of this milestone, when the specifier does not specify anything for properties view in the VSM, at runtime a default properties view will be provided.
The specifier can also define that a properties view is visible only when a Sirius element exists : Viewpoint, Representation, Layer, Filter, Mapping. For example, this means that when the end user selects an element in a diagram if the 'Documentation' layer is activated, he will see a new documentation tab with a text area. If this layer is unactivated, this tab will not be visible anymore.

###### Widgets

- checkbox **2d**
- combo **3d**
- label **2d**
- radio **2d**
- textArea **1d**
- button (test with dialogs -> browse button with fileselector /!\ lifecycle) **3d**
- dynamic mappings **3d**
  - for iterator in collectionExpression (domainClass.eAllStructuralFeatures) -> switch switchExpression -> case valueExpression
- implementation of the default behavior **1d**
- implementation of a prototype of the custom widget (color picker) **1d**
  - we will use this example to evaluate the API needed to support custom widgets

- context **10d**
  - viewpoint, representation, layer, filter, mapping
  - model explorer ~> lack of context with the Eclipse Sirius bridge

- tab order **2d**

###### EMF Edit

Feedback and improvement with the Sirius team **2d**

###### Specification of the styling **10d**

- Font
- Colors (background, foreground)
- Label (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough etc)
- Conditional style

###### Release engineering and project management **4d**

- technical documentation
- more tests


##### M6 26/03/16 (API freeze) availability 8 weeks or 65 days (planning 57 days)

The goal of this milestone is to support EMF edit by default and get a first version of validation and styling.
By default, EEF uses EMF Edit : label provider, choice of values, diagnostician, validation.
The specifier can provide custom complex widgets to his properties view description thanks to a dedicated API.
For the end user, when a validation error is thrown, the associated element in the properties view is highlighted (marker, color change).
It is possible for the specifier to provide styles for widgets. For example for a Text widget, he will be able to change the font and the foreground/background color. As in Sirius, he can also specify conditional style on widget description based on a predicate.
